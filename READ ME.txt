-============== Multiplayer Game ==============-

Create a server that listens for connections on a particular port, invoked as:
./server <port>

Then the client can connect to the server via:
./client <server name/IP> <port>


If you want to build on a local Linux install, youâ€™ll need the required SDL libraries:

*sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev*

Then, build with make -f Makefile.local.

Alternatively, the Makefile has a rule that will run the client with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, so you can
run the client with *make runclient*.
